    """
    Class for Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

    This class represents Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) which is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves 
    scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed 
    on different machines. The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the total time required
    to complete all jobs. The class contains an instance of the problem, so it can be passed into Quantum Launcher.


    Attributes:
        max_time (int): The maximum time for the scheduling problem.
        onehot (str): The one-hot encoding method to be used.
        optimization_problem (bool): Flag indicating whether the problem is an optimization problem or a decision problem.
        results (dict): Dictionary to store the results of the problem instance.

    Methods:
        set_instance: Sets the problem instance manually.
        read_instance: Reads the problem instance from a file.
